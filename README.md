# Stat-423-Final-Report

Changes I made:

Organzied document in format of:
   - Intro/data loading and cleaning; and response to teacher question 3
   - Research questions 1 - 4
   - Response to teacher question 4

Removed names declaring which section they worked on

Removed "I" and replaced with "we" #Note: as much as I noticed

Worked on reducing space taken up:
  - Globally: Reduced all figure sizes
  - For research question 1: Removed a couple unnecessary graphs as noted by Arnav
  - For research question 4: Removed the summary of regsubsets.out (kept the ones that looked at specific aspects of the summary such as r squared values)

Removed instances of people repeating similar steps in their own section such as removing NA's and put it all in one place.
